  <!--Active learning: Getting useful information from the Window object
So far we've only really looked at using Node and Document features to manipulate documents, but there is no reason why you can't 
get data from other sources and use it in your UI. You just have to make sure your data is in the right format; JavaScript makes it 
easier than many other languages, being weakly typed — for example numbers will convert to strings automatically when you want to 
print them to the screen.

In this example we will solve a common problem — making sure your application is as big as the window it is viewed in, whatever size 
it is. This is often useful in situations like games, where you want to use as much of the screen area as possible to play the game in.

To start with, make a local copy of our window-resize-example.html and bgtile.png demo files. Open it and have a look — you'll see that 
we've got a <div> element covering a small part of the screen, which has got a background tile applied to it. We'll use that to 
represent our app UI area.

First of all, let's grab a reference to the div, and then grab the width and height of the viewport (the inner window, where your 
document is displayed) and store them in variables — these two values are handily contained in the Window.innerWidth and 
Window.innerHeight properties. Add the following lines inside the existing <script> element:

const div = document.querySelector('div');
let winWidth = window.innerWidth;
let winHeight = window.innerHeight;

Next, we'll dynamically alter the width and height of the div to equal that of the viewport. Add the following two lines below your 
first ones:

div.style.width = winWidth + 'px';
div.style.height = winHeight + 'px';

Save and try refreshing your browser — you should now see the div become as big as your viewport, whatever size of screen your are 
using. If you now try resizing your window to make it bigger, you'll see that the div stays the same size — we are only setting it once.
How about we use an event so that the div resizes as we resize the window? The Window object has an event available on it called resize, 
which is fired every time the window is resized — let's access that via the Window.onresize event handler and rerun our sizing code 
each time it changes. Add the following to the bottom of your code:

window.onresize = function() {
  winWidth = window.innerWidth;
  winHeight = window.innerHeight;
  div.style.width = winWidth + 'px';
  div.style.height = winHeight + 'px';
