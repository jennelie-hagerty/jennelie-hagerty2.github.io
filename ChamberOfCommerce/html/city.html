        <h2 class="history">The History of Havelock</h2>
        <p class="author">Article by Edward Barnes Ellis, Jr</p>
        <p class="historypara">
            Havelock has always welcomed visitors. The lovely woods, creeks and Neuse River welcomed some of the
            earliest settlers in America. Our area boasted permanent plantation sites as early as 1707 and was home to
            many woodsmen, fishermen and farmers before the American Revolution.<br><br>

            This area welcomed the coming of the railroad in 1858 at a time that a British general was gaining worldwide
            fame for his heroic rescues of hostage citizens during a bloody uprising in India. When the Atlantic and
            North Carolina tracks came to a crossroads and a depot was built, it needed a name. The local folks embraced
            the name of General Henry Havelock for their budding community. Sir Henry was a devout Christian and a
            military genius. The story of his courage gives inspiration to this day.<br><br>

            This City is one of eight in the world named for Sir Henry Havelock. Two are in Canada; three are in the
            United States. There is one Havelock in Swaziland of Southern Africa and two in New Zealand. There is
            also an island named for him in the Indian Ocean.<br><br>

            The town of Havelock Station saw action during the Civil War when elements of the Rhode Island Heavy
            Artillery under the command of General Ambrose Burnside stormed ashore on the beach of what is now the
            Officer’s Club at Cherry Point and Carolina Pines Golf & Country Club. The Union forces quickly took
            control of the hamlet and its railroad depot using Havelock as a starting point for the capture of New Bern
            and
            Fort Macon. The operation in March 1862 provided the first major foothold in the South for the
            Yankees.<br><br>

            The Union troops had few kind comments about the area, calling it desolate, snake-infested and muddy.
            One correspondent said the only comfort for the soldiers was the “chain-lightning whiskey” available from
            local stores and farm houses.<br><br>

            Wills and other records indicate that production of “naval store” such as tar and turpentine had more
            economic impact here than did farming. While most people farmed, the greater income was produced through
            the operation of turpentine distilleries and tar kilns.<br><br>

            With the advent of the steam engine during and following the Civil War, wooden ships began to be
            replaced and the market for tar, pitch and turpentine collapsed. To make ends meet, more than a few local
            families switched from turpentine distillation to the distillation of something with a little more kick to
            it.
            Local legend has it that Havelock and nearby Harlowe became renowned for the quality of their “moonshine”
            and
            that a few fortunes were based on the copper coil.<br><br>

            From the late 1800’s until the 1930’s, the Havelock area was a haven for hunters and fishermen.
            Sportsmen came from all over the east coast to enjoy the river and forests. Several old-timers’ albums boast
            photos of baseball stars Babe Ruth and Christie Mathewson and then-famous cartoonist Bud Fisher decked out
            in
            hunting gear in the local woods.<br><br>

            Havelock welcomed the United States Marine Corps in 1940. Today, visitors are often seen craning their
            necks as a Harrier or Intruder streaks by overhead. Local residents are used to the roar acknowledged by a
            sign near the base’s main gate which reads, “Pardon our noise. It’s the sound of freedom.”<br><br>

        <h2 class="curdemo">Current Demographics</h2>
        <p class="curdemopara">According to the 2010 Census data, Havelock is the second most populous city in Craven
            County, hosting
            approximately 20,735 residents.<br><br>

            Havelock continues to be a growing community. This strong progressive community is dedicated to supporting
            the mission of Cherry Point, while encouraging orderly growth and development.<br><br>

            Although the area was among the first settled in North Carolina, the official population in 1950 was 100.
            The population in 1965 was about 3,500. Many of the city’s current residents are affiliated with the
            adjacent Cherry Point Marine Corps Air Station.<br><br>
