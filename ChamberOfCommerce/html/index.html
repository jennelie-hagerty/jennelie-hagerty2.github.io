        <h2 class="have">Havelock</h2>
        <p class="haveParagraph">Welcome to the City of Havelock, North Carolina
            Located in Eastern North Carolina, midway between historic New Bern and the beautiful beaches of the Crystal
            Coast, Havelock has much to offer residents and visitors alike. Havelock is proud to be the home of Marine
            Corps Air Station Cherry Point, the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing and the Fleet Readiness Center – East. A city
            of 22,500, Havelock is a great place to live or visit, blending old fashioned Southern hospitality with a of
            cultural diversity.

        <h2 class="cherry">Cherry Point</h2>
        <p class="cpParagraph1">When visitors come to Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, one of the first things
            many of them notice is the roar of jet aircraft passing over the front gate on their way to or from
            runway number 5/23. On a sign outside the gate, are the words:</p>
        <p class="cpMotto" style="font-style: italic;">“Pardon our noise, it’s the sound of freedom.”</p>
        <p class="cpParagraph2">For more than 75 years, those sounds of freedom have echoed through local skies, from
            the deep, guttural growl of amphibious biplanes and single-wing attack aircraft during World War II, to the
            piercing whine of today’s sleek and
            sophisticated jets. Those sounds are music to the ears of the Marines who fight on the ground, for there is
            nothing Marines like better than to have Marine artillery behind them, Marine intelligence in front of
            them and Marine aircraft overhead.<br><br>

            Located only 20 miles from some of the Atlantic’s most beautiful beaches, Cherry Point is about 90 miles
            west-southwest of Cape Hatteras, at the foot of the great Outer Banks. It is perhaps appropriate that
            the
            home of such a powerful aviation arsenal is just down the coast from Kitty Hawk, where winged aviation got
            its start.<br><br>

            Duty at Cherry Point is challenging. Whether you’re headed for the 2d Marine Aircraft Wing for duty with the
            Fleet Marine Force, or support service with the air station or one of ts tenant activities, the tasks
            are
            varied and rewarding. And they’re all directed toward the same end — providing country and Corps with a
            combat-ready aerial striking force. </p>

        <h2 class="surrounding">Surrounding Areas</h2>

        <h2 class="bern">New Bern</h2>
        <p class="bernParagraph">New Bern was settled in 1710 by Swiss and Palatine immigrants led by Christoph von
            Graffenried. They named the settlement after Bern, the capital of Switzerland. But long before the Europeans
            arrived, the
            Tuscarora indians also lived along New Bern's riverbanks in a village they called Chattoka.<br><br>

            New Bern is the second-oldest colonial town in North Carolina and was the capital of the North Carolina
            colonial government. For a short period of time it was also the state capital. Given its picturesque
            setting and growing political prestige, New Bern quickly became known as "the Athens of the South." You'll
            find the
            Athens Theater and the Masonic Temple downtown, part of the rich culture of New Bern then, are still
            very active today.<br><br>

            New Bern is rich in history and culture, part of its charm and appeal to visitors young and old. Visit the
            Firemen's Museum and NC History Center to find out more about the history of New Bern. Step back in time
            as you walk through the Governor's mansion at Tryon Palace. And top it all off with an ice cold Pepsi, in
            the
            city where Pepsi was born. Stroll our downtown and you'll find yourself amongst some of the most
            beautiful historic districts in the South. No matter your pleasure, there's something for everyone here. We
            hope
            you enjoy your visit. </p>

        <h2 class="crystal">Crystal Coast</h2>
        <p class="crystalParagraph"> The Crystal Coast is an 85-mile stretch of coastline that extends from the Cape
            Lookout National Seashore, which includes 56 miles of protected beaches, southwestward to the New River. The
            Crystal Coast is a
            popular area with tourists and second-home owners in the summer.<br><br>

            The main area includes all the major Carteret County beaches (those on Bogue Banks, which face south).
            It also includes eastern portions of Carteret County, such as Harkers Island, Down East and Shackleford
            Banks, as well as the northern Onslow County beaches (Bear Island/Hammock's Beach), and a few ports along
            the
            Intercostal Waterway. <br><br>

            The main communities include the coastal resorts of Atlantic Beach, Emerald Isle, Indian Beach, Pine Knoll
            Shores and Salter Path, as well as the inland (sound-side) ports of Beaufort, Morehead City, and
            Swansboro. Besides the many quiet beach communities and numerous shops and restaurants in the area, other
            major
            attractions include Fort Macon State Park, which protects a series of historic coastal forts used from
            the early 19th to the mid 20th century, and the North Carolina Aquarium at Pine Knoll Shores, one of three
            such aquariums located along the North Carolina coast. A population of feral Banker horses is located on
            Shackleford Banks, and several protected areas, including Hammocks Beach State Park, Cape Lookout National
            Seashore (including the ghost town of Portsmouth) lie along the region as well.
