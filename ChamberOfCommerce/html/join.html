        <p class="servingpara">Located at 201 Tourist Center Drive inside the Havelock Tourist and Event Center, the
            Havelock Chamber of
            Commerce provides a platform for businesses to come together to work towards common goals and serve as a

            The Havelock Chamber of Commerce is proud to be a Chamber that sets itself apart from the others by giving
            back to the community through our events. These events raise money for the local non-profits and schools in
            our community to help the citizens of Havelock remain strong. The Havelock Chamber of Commerce is also very
            proud to work closely with MCAS Cherry Point, one of the largest Marine corps Air Stations in the world and
            Fleet Readiness Center East, the largest industrial employer east of I-95.<br><br>

        <p class="macpara">
        The purpose of the Havelock Chamber of Commerce Military Affairs Committee (MAC) is to maintain and enhance
        the relationship between the military-civilian communities such that the MCAS Cherry Point population is
        reassured that their paramount contribution to the area economic, political, cultural, and social well-being
        is recognized. To accomplish this purpose, the MAC serves as a vital, informal communication link among and
        between MCAS Cherry Point, the Chamber of Commerce, the Havelock Board of Commissioners, the Craven County
        Commissioners, and state and federal legislators.

        The MAC sponsorship of many activities such as: The MAC Military Family of the Quarter, where active duty
        military families are recognized for their selfless service to our country and community involvement. The
        MAC also provides meals for Marines and Sailors at numerous times throughout the year, again in recognition
        and thanks for their dedicated service. The Havelock MAC can also be seen participating in many parades
        throughout the year to promote awareness of the military contributions in our surrounding communities.

        Membership in the MAC is open to all Chamber of Commerce members and is comprised in large part of retired
        military service members. From former Marine Corps Aviators to Navy Corpsman, the MAC has a profound
        understanding and appreciation for the countless selfless service that our men and women in uniform provide.
        Although prior military service is not a requirement and all are welcomed to participate.<br><br>

        If you are not already a member of the Havelock Chamber of Commerce, please accept this invitation to join us!
